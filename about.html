    <h1>About the scanner</h1>
    <p>This scanner app is designed specifically to work with the art work - Tower of Babel by Brian Gibson. The scanner coverts areas of light and shade to play and trigger sounds as the scanner passes over the work. Just like the visual artwork, the scanner uses the same remains of once functional and valued digital equipment to create unintended sounds by interacting with the components and cases in various ways.</p>
    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>When you press 'start' you should hopefully see a pixelated, monochrome image of yourself. Press the cam button to switch to front facing camera</p>
    <p>Use the pixelated image to locate the artwork. You should here some background sounds. When you hold the trigger button more sounds are triggered by areas of darkness on the image</p>
    <p>Move the scanner along the artwork to hear different sounds</p>
    <p>Release the trigger button to stop the trigger sounds</p>
    <p>Press stop to, er, stop</p>
    <button onclick="document.location='index.html'">back to scanner</button>
